# Introduction

This repo contains the necessary code for snow water equivalent (SWE) prediction and projection in the Western CONUS. A corresponding presentation can be found at [here](https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10509011.1). We will update our manuscript when it is ready.  

The 'ensemble' files performes initial-weight ensemble run for the deep learning models. 

The 'Projection' is for projection analysis with RCP8.5 LOCA datasets.
